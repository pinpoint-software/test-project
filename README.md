# Pinpoint.Links - Finished Project
*by Zach Meyer*

Here is a completed form of the Pinpoint.Links project, written by Zach Meyer.

## Few Things Of Note

* There is a lot of repeating code, especially since Text submissions are very similar to Link submissions. Ideally, I would like to compress more of the code (such as in the case with SubmissionForm/SubmissionList), but it was not necessarily a requirement at this time

* This project runs immediately out of the box (with composer dependencies installed) using PHP's built-in development web server, which improves portability (just run *php -S localhost:8000* in the root project folder and make magic happen)

* Noticed some issues with composer dependency installation in a Windows environment. Had to install composer dependencies in a Linux environment and then move it back to Windows


Fun challenge! I learned a lot.
